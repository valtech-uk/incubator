Introduction
==================================================

SimpleUpload is a small simple J2EE application for quickly setting up a file upload server.
It uses the commons-fileupload library internally to do the heavy lifting.


Installation
==================================================

SimpleUpload is a standard Maven 2 project.
To download the dependencies and build the WAR file, just cd to the project root folder and run:

	> mvn install

The generated WAR file can then be installed into your preferred J2EE application server (e.g.: Tomcat, JBoss).

To run locally in a Jetty application server:

	> mvn jetty:run


Configuration
==================================================

Configuration values are read from the following locations, in order of precedence:

	1. Java system properties.
	2. simpleupload.properties in the classpath (when built using Maven, one is included in the generated WAR).
	3. Internal hard-coded defaults.

In practice, this means that you will probably configure SimpleUpload using system properties to override the
values included in the simpleupload.properties file in the WAR.

For Tomcat, you can add the properties to <Tomcat>/conf/catalina.properties
For Jetty (run as Maven plugin), do:
	> export MAVEN_OPTS='-Dupload.<property>=<value>' ; mvn jetty:run

Properties that you will probably want to change:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- upload.folder
This specifies the folder in which to save the uploaded files.

- upload.maxBytes
This specifies the maximum size allowed for uploads, in bytes.

Other properties:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- upload.inMemory.maxBytes
Uploaded files smaller than this value (in bytes) will be stored in memory during the upload.
Files larger than this value will be streamed to disk as they are uploaded.

- upload.title
This value will be used as the title and header of the upload page.
HTML is allowed here, and will be written to the page as-is.


Source notes
==================================================

- index.jsp
The main upload web page, contains the main UI for uploading files.

- upload.jsp
Contains the form for submitting the file for upload.  Included as an iFrame by index.jsp.

- SimpleUploadServlet.java
The main upload servlet.
Provides a POST request handler for accepting file data for upload.  Redirects back to upload.jsp when complete.
Provides a GET request handler for querying the progress of uploaded files.  Returns a JSON response.
